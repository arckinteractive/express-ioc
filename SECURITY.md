# Security Policy

# Reporting a Bug

The Arck Interactive team takes all security bugs in our projects seriously, but as a
full-time development agency, we don't always have the time to address isues promptly.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort toacknowledge
yourcontributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at team@arckinteractive.com.

## Disclosure Policy

When our  team receives a security bug report, it will be assigned to a primary developer. 
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
